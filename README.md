# Money Mavericks - Impact of Education & Unemployment on Income Insecurity in the U.S.

## **Motivation**
      Amidst the rapidly changing modern workforce, income insecurity has become a growing concern for millions of people in the US, and around the world. The impact that education and unemployment has on income insecurity cannot be ignored. There are millions of people who lack the necessary skills (engineering, sales, business) to compete in today’s job market. This inevitably makes individuals more vulnerable to periods of unemployment which leads to financial instability. Meanwhile, even those able to secure employment may still struggle to make ends meet if their jobs do not provide a living wage or if they do not have the necessary skills to secure higher-paying positions. This often results in individuals having to work more than one job. This topic is of utmost importance as it will allow us to examine the factors that contribute to this systemic issue. By understanding the impact of education and unemployment on income insecurity we will be better equipped to create a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

## **Background**
      Income insecurity is a significant concern for millions of people, and its impact on families is far-reaching. This is often further exacerbated by periods of unemployment, especially for individuals who don’t have the necessary skills to compete in today’s highly competitive market. With more and more Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck people often don’t have much to fall back on in times of trouble. Even so, those who are employed are still faced with non-livable wages and limited opportunities to climb the corporate ladder, further compounding income insecurity. 

      The COVID-19 pandemic and inflation at a historic high has only made things worse. The pandemic illustrated the importance of higher education, as most of the jobs that were impacted were those with lower barriers to entry (customer service, hospitality, retail). With that said, it’s critical to understand the impact that education and unemployment has on income insecurity. 

      Fortunately, in times of adversity the government provides eligible low-income households with a set amount of money to purchase food. This program is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). As such, SNAP participant data will likely prove useful in assessing income insecure households across the country. Additionally, analyzing Department of Education (DoE) funding and IRS income data will also help us paint a better picture of how rampant this issue is.

## **Goal**
      Our goal is to analyze income insecurity in the United States and determine whether it happens at higher rates between rural and urban areas using SNAP participant data, DoE funding and IRS income data by state.

## **Datasets**
      In order to analyze income insecurity around the country we first need to understand the underlying factors such as education, unemployment, and SNAP participation by state. With that said, we will begin with the Department of Education’s (DoE) funding which is publicly available on their website. Secondly, we will source unemployment data from various sources beginning with Statista’s unemployment by state. Education and unemployment will provide us with a baseline to evaluate how it relates to statewide SNAP participation.
